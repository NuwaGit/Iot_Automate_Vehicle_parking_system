Create a detailed electronic circuit diagram for a parking management system showing:

MAIN COMPONENTS:
1. Raspberry Pi 4 (USB-C power port, USB ports, GPIO pins visible)
2. ESP32 Dev Board (micro-USB port, GPIO pins labeled)
3. LM2596 Buck Converter Module (input/output terminals visible)
4. 12V DC Power Adapter
5. 1 USB Web Camera
6. 1 IR Sensor Module (3 pins: VCC, GND, OUT)
7. 2 SG90 Servo Motors (each with 3 wires: Red/VCC, Brown/GND, Orange/Signal)
8. 1 Active Buzzer (2 terminals: + and -)
9. 10kΩ Resistor
10. 220Ω Resistor
11. Breadboard (with power rails)

POWER SUPPLY CONNECTIONS:
- 12V DC Adapter positive (IN+) connected to LM2596 IN+ terminal
- 12V DC Adapter negative (IN-) connected to LM2596 IN- terminal
- LM2596 OUT+ (5V) connected to breadboard positive rail (red rail)
- LM2596 OUT- (GND) connected to breadboard negative rail (blue/black rail)
- Raspberry Pi powered via USB-C (5V, 3A adapter - show separately)

ESP32 POWER:
- ESP32 VIN pin connected to LM2596 5V rail (optional - can also use USB)
- ESP32 GND pin connected to common GND rail

IR SENSOR (Parking Slot Detection):
- IR Sensor VCC pin connected to 5V rail
- IR Sensor GND pin connected to GND rail
- IR Sensor OUT pin connected to ESP32 GPIO 2
- 10kΩ pull-up resistor connected between ESP32 GPIO 2 and 3.3V (from ESP32)

ENTRY GATE SERVO MOTOR (SG90):
- Servo Red wire (VCC) connected to LM2596 5V rail (NOT ESP32)
- Servo Brown/Black wire (GND) connected to GND rail
- Servo Orange/Yellow wire (Signal) connected to ESP32 GPIO 13

EXIT GATE SERVO MOTOR (SG90):
- Servo Red wire (VCC) connected to LM2596 5V rail (NOT ESP32)
- Servo Brown/Black wire (GND) connected to GND rail
- Servo Orange/Yellow wire (Signal) connected to ESP32 GPIO 12

BUZZER:
- Buzzer positive terminal connected to ESP32 GPIO 14 via 220Ω resistor
- Buzzer negative terminal connected to GND rail

SERIAL COMMUNICATION (ESP32 to Raspberry Pi):
- ESP32 GPIO 1 (TX) connected to USB-to-Serial adapter RX pin
- ESP32 GPIO 3 (RX) connected to USB-to-Serial adapter TX pin
- ESP32 GND connected to USB-to-Serial adapter GND
- USB-to-Serial adapter USB connector connected to Raspberry Pi USB port
(Alternative: ESP32 GPIO 1 → Raspberry Pi GPIO 15, ESP32 GPIO 3 → Raspberry Pi GPIO 14, with common GND)

CAMERA:
- USB Camera connected directly to Raspberry Pi USB port

VISUAL DETAILS:
- Use different colors for power rails (red for 5V, black/blue for GND)
- Label all GPIO pins with numbers (GPIO 2, GPIO 12, GPIO 13, GPIO 14, GPIO 1, GPIO 3)
- Show ESP32 as a rectangular microcontroller with labeled pins
- Show Raspberry Pi as a single board computer with visible ports
- Draw clean connecting lines between components
- Include component labels and pin labels
- Show breadboard structure with power rails on sides
- Add a legend or component list if space allows
- Use standard electronic symbols where appropriate
- Make the diagram clear and easy to follow for wiring

LAYOUT SUGGESTION:
- Place power supply section (12V adapter + LM2596) on the left
- Center ESP32 with breadboard
- Place all sensors and actuators around ESP32
- Place Raspberry Pi on the right
- Show connections with clear lines and labels
